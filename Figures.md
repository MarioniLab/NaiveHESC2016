**Figure 1. Gene expression differs between naive and primed human ESCs.**   
(A) _Experimental setup (Ferdinand)_  
(B) PCA plot of logged expression values of ESCs coloured according to their expression of naive marker KLF4. The subpopulations are separated in the first component with a variance of 31%.  
(C) Logged fold change of gene expression values between naive and primed pseudo bulk data sets.
Significant up-regulation in gene expression indicated primed markers (blue), significantly down-regulated genes were considered naive markers (orange).
Each two most differentially expressed markers as well as ~~common?(Guo)~~ naive markers were labeled explicitly.  

   
**Figure 2. Putative transition cells may form a separate subpopulation with transcriptional features between the naive and primed state.**  
(A) ~~Heat map showing~~ mean-corrected expression values for DE genes between transition and naive cells (top), for DE genes between primed and transition cells (centre) and for genes present in both DE sets (bottom).
Numbers above the boxes indicate population size.  
(B) Log-expression profiles of naive (top), putative transition (centre) and primed (bottom) cells for ~~common?~~ naive markers. 
Each point indicates a cells, coloured according to its respective subpopulation.  
(C) _FaCS (Ferdinand)_  


**Figure 3. Increased heterogeneity in expression within primed than within naive subpopulation.**  
(A) Overall number of highly variable genes with a biological component of log-fold change greater than or equal to 0.5 at a FDR of 5%.  
(B) Biological component of variance for genes that are highly variable within both the naive and the primed subpopulation. Cells are coloured according to listed GO functions.   
(C) Biological component of variance for highly variable genes that are unique in the primed subset and unique in the naive subset. 


**Figure 4. ESCs on a temporal trajectory shift from a naive-like to a primed-like expression pattern for DE markers.**  
Proportions per cent of the expression of naive and primed markers for human ESCs on a temporal trajectory from stage E3 to E7 (Figure 4A), for mouse (*Mus muscles*) ESCs from E3.5 to E6.75 with orthologous genes (Figure 4B) and for monkey (*Macaca fascicularis*) ESCs from E6 to E9 and E13 to E17 (Figure 4C).
Cells on the red line have equal proportions of expressed primed and naive markers.
Expression of a marker gene was considered significant if counts for the gene were greater than 10.
Proportions indicate the amount of expressed markers over the total amount of markers for the subpopulation.
Points are coloured according to cell density.

**Figure 1.** No Figure 1 yet.

**Figure 2. PCA plot of log-expression values of human ESCs coloured according to their respective subpopulation indicates a transition state from naive to primed cells.**
The putative transition subpopulation was identified by clustering naive cells into three subsets based on euclidian distances and selecting the most protruded one.
Initial naive cells in that transition cluster were coloured in green, suggesting the additional subpopulation between naive and primed.  

**Figure 3. Augmented variability of gene expression in primed than in naive subpopulation is not driven by cell cycle or technical effects.**  
(A) Overall numbers of primed and naive cells in cell cycle phases G1, G2M and S. 
Cells were categorised by means of human cell cycle genes and the cyclone function in scran.  
(B) Total number of expressed genes in primed and naive ESCs and total number of expressed genes present in both subsets.
Low-abundance genes with mean counts less than 1 were neglected.  
(C) Histogram of logged means of all genes with a mean count equal to or greater than 1.   
(D) Distribution of size factors of endogenous genes with a mean count equal to or greater than 1.   

**Figure 4. Proportions of significant expression of naive and primed markers for naive, transition and primed cells demonstrate proof of concept.** 
Expression was considered significant if counts for respective marker genes were greater than 10. 
The red line indicates an equilibrium of significantly expressed primed and naive markers.
Colouring shows the number of cells with the exact same proportions.
