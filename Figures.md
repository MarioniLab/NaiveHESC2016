**Figure 1. Gene expression differs between naive and primed human ESCs.**   
(A) Experimental setup (Ferdinand)  
(B) PCA plot of logged expression values of ESCs coloured according to their expression of naive marker KLF4 separates naive and primed subpopulations in first component.  
(C) Logged fold change of gene expression values between naive and primed pseudo bulk data sets.
Significant up-regulation in gene expression indicated primed markers (blue), naive markers were significantly down-regulated (orange).
Each two most differentially expressed markers as well as ~~common?(Guo)~~ naive markers were labeled explicitly.  

   
**Figure 2. Putative transition cells may form a separate subpopulation with transcriptional features between the naive and primed state.**  
(A) Mean-corrected expression values for DE genes between transition and naive cells (top), for DE genes between primed and transition cells (centre) and for genes present in both DE sets (bottom).
Numbers above the boxes indicate population size.  
(B) Log-expression profiles of naive (top), putative transition (centre) and primed (bottom) cells for ~~common?~~ naive markers.   Points show cells coloured according to their respective subpopulation.  
(C) FACs (Ferdinand)  


**Figure 3. Increased heterogeneity in expression within primed than within naive subpopulation.**  
(A) Overall number of highly variable genes with a biological component of log-fold change greater than or equal to 0.5 and a FDR of 5%.  
(B) Biological component of variance for genes that are highly variable within both the naive and the primed subpopulation. Cells are coloured according to listed GO functions.   
(C) Biological component of variance for non-shared highly variable genes.  


**Figure 4. ESCs on a temporal trajectory shift from a naive-like to a primed-like expression of DE markers.**  
(A) Proportions per cent of the expression of naive and primed markers for human ESC in a temporal trajectory from stage E3 to E7. Points are coloured according to cell density.  
(B) Proportions per cent of the expression of orthologous genes to naive and primed markers for mouse (*Mus muscles*) ESC in a temporal trajectory from stage E3.5 to E6.75. 
(C) Proportions per cent of the expression of naive and primed markers for monkey (*Macaca fascicularis*) ESC in a temporal trajectory from stage E6 to E9 and stage E13 to E17.
